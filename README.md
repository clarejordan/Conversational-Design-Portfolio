# Conversational Design Portfolio — Clare Jordan, LPCC

A curated set of 5 projects that demonstrate clear problem-solving through conversational interfaces in mental health:
1. **Therapist Matching Intake Assistant** — empathetic, low-friction intake that improves match quality  
2. **CBT Self-Help Coach** — guided cognitive restructuring between sessions  
3. **DBT Distress De-escalation** — safety-first coping flow with escalation guardrails  
4. **Teen Support Buddy** — youth-friendly tone, ACT/mindfulness micro-skills  
5. **Psychiatry Follow-Up & Side-Effects Tracker** — adherence, monitoring, and flags for clinician review

> Each project includes: problem statement, design rationale, flow diagram (Mermaid), example dialog, safety guardrails,  and success metrics.
