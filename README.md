# Conversational Design Portfolio — Clare Jordan, LPCC

This portfolio highlights projects that show how I approach problem-solving through conversational interfaces in mental health care. Each example includes a problem statement, design rationale, flow diagram, example dialog, safety guardrails, and alignment with best practices in therapy and user experience.

## Projects
- [01-intake-matcher](./01-intake-matcher/README.md) — A guided intake conversation that improves therapist matching and reduces client drop-off  
- [02-cbt-coach](./02-cbt-coach/README.md) — A short CBT exercise to support skill practice between sessions  
- [03-dbt-distress](./03-dbt-distress/README.md) — A de-escalation flow using DBT skills with safety guardrails  
- [04-teen-support](./04-teen-support/README.md) — A youth-friendly assistant that provides simple stress management tools  
- [05-psychiatry-followup](./05-psychiatry-followup/README.md) — A weekly check-in to track mood, sleep, and side effects, with alerts for follow-up

These projects are designed to demonstrate my ability to blend clinical expertise, user experience, and conversational design principles in order to make mental health care more accessible, effective, and safe.
