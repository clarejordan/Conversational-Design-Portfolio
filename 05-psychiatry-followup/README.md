# Psychiatry Follow-Up and Side-Effects Tracker

## Overview
A weekly check-in that helps clients track mood, sleep, adherence, and side effects. Concerning patterns are flagged for clinician review.

## Problem
Psychiatry visits are often spaced weeks apart. Without interim check-ins, side effects or mood changes may go unnoticed.
