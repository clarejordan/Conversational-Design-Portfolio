# Therapist Matching Intake Assistant

## Overview
A step-by-step intake conversation that replaces long forms with a friendly chat. Goal: reduce drop-off, capture preferences, and improve match quality.

## Problem
New clients often feel anxious when completing long forms. Important details about their goals or preferences may be missed, which can lead to poor matches and reschedules.
