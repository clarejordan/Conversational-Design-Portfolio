# CBT Self-Help Coach

## Overview
A short between-session exercise that guides a CBT thought record. Identify the situation, automatic thought, evidence for and against, balanced reframe, and a small action.

## Problem
Clients often forget or avoid CBT homework. A guided chat lowers the effort and helps them practice skills.
