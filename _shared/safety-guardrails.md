# Safety Guardrails

These patterns are used in all projects to keep conversations safe and respectful.

## When to Escalate
- Mentions of self-harm or harm to others  
- Suicide plans, intent, or access to means  
- Medical emergencies or life-threatening symptoms  

**Action:** Express care, clearly state the limits of the assistant, provide crisis information, and encourage contacting emergency services or a trusted person. Always offer a handoff to a human when possible.

## Crisis Snippet
> I am sorry you are feeling this much pain. I am not able to keep you safe in an emergency.  
> If you are in immediate danger, call your local emergency number right now.  
> In the United States, you can dial or text **988** for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  
> If you can, reach out to a trusted person nearby for support.  

## Communication Standards
- Validate feelings, reflect back what you hear, and keep responses short and clear  
- Do not use diagnostic labels or make treatment promises  
- Do not store sensitive details in plain text. Keep notes minimal and focused on the current step  

## Consent and Transparency
- Explain what the assistant can and cannot do  
- Be clear when information may be shared with a clinician  

## Privacy
- Collect only what is needed for the current step  
- Always offer “skip” or “prefer not to say” as options
