- Ask one question at a time.
- Offer choices and opt-outs.

**Avoid**
- Jargon, long paragraphs, or moralizing.
- Making clinical guarantees or diagnoses.

**Micro-skills used in scripts**

- Normalization: “Many people feel…”
- Permission: “Is it okay if we…”
- Teach-back: “Does that summary fit?”
